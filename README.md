### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
The BikeShare project uses data from 3 cities that have a bikesharing service. The data includes details on the users and bike journeys that have taken place within the 3 cities. The bikeshare.py file allows the user to select the city, month, and day of interest, and then produces statistics on the journeys that match these parameters. The user is also able to view and scroll through the raw data.

### Files used
bikeshare.py
###Note that the city datafiles that are used by the bikeshare program are not included in this respository.



### Credits
